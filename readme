# Please Review Solved Exercises

Please review the solved exercises and provide your feedback for writing cleaner and more efficient code.

this is some git commands use to switch and work with branch

git checkout -b refactor-branch
git branch -a
git add .
git commit -m " Refactor : calculator problem "
git checkout main
git checkout refactor-branch
git push -u origin refactor-branch
